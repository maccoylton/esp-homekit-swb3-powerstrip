# esp-homekit-swb3-powerstrip
Homekit firmware for SWb3 powerstrip



This is for the 3 socket, 2 USB port, SWB3 powerstrip, sold under the brands SIPAILING, LINHGANZH, YAGALA.

One button press turn on or off scoket one, two button presses turns on or off all scoket. 

I had to open the devices to flash the firmware, as they use TUYA wifi circuits and I have not foudn a way yet to flash this with our homekit firmwares OTA. Once the firmware is on there then OTA flashing wil work for future updates.
