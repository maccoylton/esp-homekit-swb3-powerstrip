# esp-homekit-swb3-powerstrip
Homekit firmware for SWb3 powerstrip

**25-april-2022 New capability added to preserve the power state over a power outage. By default the state will not be preserved, if you want to change the default to preserve the state then using Eve app set "Preserve State" to "On"**

This is for the 3 socket, 2 USB port, SWB3 powerstrip, sold under the brands SIPAILING, LINHGANZH, YAGALA.

One button press turn on or off scoket one, two button presses turns on or off all scoket. 

I had to open the devices to flash the firmware, as they use TUYA wifi circuits and I have not found  a way yet to flash this with our homekit firmwares OTA. Once the firmware is on there then OTA flashing will work for future updates.
